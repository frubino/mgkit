    .. versionadded:: 0.2.1

    Creates a semidbm database, using an annotation `uid` as key and the gff
    line as value. The object is synced before being returned.

    .. note::

        A GFF line is used instead of a json representation because it was
        more compact when semidbm was tested.

    Arguments:
        annotations (iterable): iterable of annotations
        file_name (str): database file name, opened with the `c` flag.

    Returns:
        object: a semidbm database object

    A wrapper for a semidbm instance, used to convert the GFF line stored in

    passed to the init method, a DB will be opened with the `c` flag.

    The object behaves like a dictionary, wrapping the access to annoations
    using a *uid* as key and converting the line into an
