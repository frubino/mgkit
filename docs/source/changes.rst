Changes
=======

0.1.14
------

* added ipthon notebooks to the documentation. As of this version the included ones (in `docs/source/examples`) are for two plot modules. Also added a bash script to convert them into rst files to be included with the documentation. The *.rst* are not versioned, and they must be rebuild, meaning that one of the requirements for building the docs is to have `IPython <http://ipython.org>`_ installed with the notebook extension
* now importing some packages automatically import the subpackages as well
* refactored :mod:`mgkit.plots` into a package, with most of the original functions imported into it, for backward compatibility
* added :func:`mgkit.graphs.build_weighted_graph`
* added *box_vert* parameter in :func:`mgkit.plots.boxplot.add_values_to_boxplot`, the default will be changed in a later version (kept for compatibility with older scripts/notebooks)
* added an heatmap module to the plots package. Examples are in the notebook
* added :func:`mgkit.align.covered_annotation_bp` to find the number of bp covered by reads in annotations (as opposed to using the annotation length)
* added documentation to :class:`mgkit.mappings.eggnog.NOGInfo` and an additional method
* added :func:`mgkit.net.uniprot.get_uniprot_ec_mappings` as it was used in a few scripts already
* added :func:`mgkit.mappings.enzyme.change_mapping_level` and other to deal with EC numbers. Also improved documentation with some examples
* added :func:`mgkit.counts.func.load_sample_counts_to_genes` and :func:`mgkit.counts.func.load_sample_counts_to_taxon`, for mapping counts to only genes or taxa. Also added *index* parameter in :func:`mgkit.counts.func.map_counts` to accomodate the changes
* added :func:`mgkit.net.uniprot.get_ko_to_eggnog_mappings` to get mappings of KO identifiers to eggNOG
* added :func:`mgkit.io.gff.split_gff_file` to split a gff into several ones, assuring that all annotations for a sequence is in the same file; useful to split massive GFF files before filtering
* added :func:`mgkit.counts.func.load_deseq2_results` to load DESeq2 results in *CSV* format
* added :func:`mgkit.counts.scaling.scale_rpkm` for scale with rpkm a count table
* added caching options to :func:`mgkit.counts.func.load_sample_counts` and others
* fixes and improvements to documentation

* added :exc:`mgkit.taxon.NoLcaFound`
* fixed behaviour of :meth:`mgkit.taxon.UniprotTaxonomy.get_ranked_taxon` for newer taxonomies
* change behaviour of :meth:`mgkit.taxon.UniprotTaxonomy.is_ancestor` to use module :func:`mgkit.taxon.is_ancestor` and accept multiple taxon IDs to test
* :meth:`mgkit.taxon.UniprotTaxonomy.load_data` now accept compressed data and file handles
* added :func:`mgkit.taxon.lowest_common_ancestor` to find the lowest common ancestor of two taxon IDs
* changed behaviour of :func:`mgkit.taxon.parse_uniprot_taxon`
* added functions to get GC content, ratio of a sequence and it composition to :mod:`mgkit.utils.sequence`
* added more options to **blast2gff** script
* added *coverage*, *taxonomy* and *unipfile* to **add-gff-info**
* refactored **snp_parser** to use new classes
* added possibility to use sorted GFF files as input for **filter-gff** to use less memory (the examples show how to use *sort* in Unix)

0.1.12
------

* added functions to elongate annotations, measure the coverage of them and diff GFF files in :mod:`mgkit.io.gff`
* added ranges_length and union_ranges to :mod:`mgkit.utils.common`

0.1.11

* refactored some tests and added more
* added `docs_req.txt` to help build the documentation ont readthedocs.org
* renamed :class:`mgkit.snps.classes.GeneSyn` gid and taxon attributes to gene_id and taxon_id. The old names are still available for use (via properties), but the will be taken out in later versions. Old pickle data should be loaded and saved again before in this release
