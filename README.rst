Metagenomics Framework
======================

The aim of this library [#]_ is to provide a series of useful modules and packages to make it easier to build custom pipelines for metagenomics or any kind of bioinformatics analysis. It integrates other well known python libraries in bioinformatics, like HTSeq `HTSeq <http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/>`_, `pysam <https://code.google.com/p/pysam/>`_, `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ and `scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_.

A pipeline is provided, along with all the scripts used to reproduce the results in (link).
